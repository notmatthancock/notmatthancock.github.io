<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/me.png" style="float:left; padding-right: 50px; padding-bottom: 20px;" /> Hello. I'm Matt. I'm a PhD candidate in applied and computational mathematics at Florida State University. I'm interested in image and signal processing, pattern recognition, and applying the previous two topics to biomedical imaging problems.

I use this site for notes, derivations, and assorted ramblings related to math and computers. Maybe my attempts to organize my own thoughts will help you, too :)
