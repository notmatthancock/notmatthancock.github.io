A bit ago, there was a story on [y combinator news about the potato paradox](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9894237). I mentioned that I had small list of math theorems loosely related to food. The list grew. An attempt was made to establish the list on Wikipedia. It was deleted.

So, I'm sharing here because it's interesting trivia. It's not strictly mathematics, but loosely math / science related. Anyhow, here it is:

* [Ham sandwich theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ham_sandwich_theorem)
* [Hamburger moment problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburger_moment_problem)
* [No free lunch theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_free_lunch_theorem)
* [Squeeze (sandwich) theorem ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeeze_theorem)
* [Layer cake representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layer_cake_representation)
* [Pizza theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_theorem)
* [Potato paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato_paradox)
* [Pancake sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancake_sorting)
* [Fair cake-cutting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_cake-cutting)
* [Fair pie-cutting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_pie-cutting)
* [Blancmange curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blancmange_curve)
* [Spaghetti sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_sort)
* [McNugget numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin_problem#McNugget_numbers)
* [Pretzel link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretzel_link)
* [Chinese restaurant process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_restaurant_process)
* [Lazy caterer's sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_caterer%27s_sequence)
* [Cake number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cake_number)
* [Spaghetti code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code)

Apparently, we are quite inspired by food and / or need to quit working while hungry :)
