# 2D, Two-class Classification Dataset Maker

Point and click to add points of each class type (left-click for "class-0"; right-click for "class-1"). Click existing points to remove them. You can share (via a url) and download (as plain text) the resulting datasets.

Often, synthetic datasets are created by defining points of a particular class to lie in some region that is defined functionally, and then adding noise; or by assuming a particular distribution type for each class and generating random data. This is fine, but sometimes it's just easier to point and click! That's what this web-app is intended for.
